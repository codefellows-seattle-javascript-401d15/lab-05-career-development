# lab-05 career development - big O notation

## Purpose
This is intended to explore the O(n) methods on arrays by writing them out in vanilla JS and testing them.

## Setup
You will need node, mocha and chai installed as devDependencies.  Run ```npm init``` and follow prompts.
Then run ```npm i -D mocha chai```

## Usage
```mocha``` is the only relevant command, as this will execute the tests.


### Attributions
- Allie Grampa: helped me get the methods initially written.
- I took a look at a few repositories, including: https://github.com/cameronmbacon/lab-05-career-development/ for ideas on testing, but couldn't implement much.
